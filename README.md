# Berkeley Summer Sessions Analysis
This repo contains the final report for an analysis conducted for the UC Berkeley Summer Sessions Pre-College Scholars Program (a Summer program for high school students to take college-level courses at Berkeley that attracts students from all over the globe) in the Summer of 2021. More specifically, this project focuseds on disparities in academic performance for two pairs of cohorts: 16- vs. 17-year-old students and in-state students vs. out-of-state and international students. The project was completed as a Jupyter notebook in Python using the Pandas-esque `datascience` library developed at UC Berkeley specifically for their Introductory Data Science course Data C8 (documentation linked [here](http://data8.org/datascience/)). Data used in this project has been modified or excluded to remain FERPA compliant. The IPYNB file and an html rendering of the Notebook are included in this repository.
